      "entry": "This morning, I finished up Daily Journal Part 5. The challenge asked us to \"clean up\" our journal.js file by creating three new js files. I moved the API data handling functions into data.js. I moved the HTML building function into entryComponent.js. I moved the DOM building functions into entriesDOM.js. In each new js file, I declared objects which store all of these functions as methods. This is called modularization. It makes it easier to read code. This was pretty challenging but also very rewarding.",
