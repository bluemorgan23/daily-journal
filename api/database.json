      "entry": "This morning, I finished up Daily Journal Part 5. The challenge asked us to \"clean up\" our journal.js file by creating three new js files. I moved the API data handling functions into data.js. I moved the HTML building function into entryComponent.js. I moved the DOM building functions into entriesDOM.js. In each new js file, I declared objects which store all of these functions as methods. This is called modularization. It makes it easier to read code. This was pretty challenging but also very rewarding.",

This was difficult to achieve, but it was a great learning experience on how GRUNT works. Then, installing browserify and making sure the file paths were all correct was a learning experience. I was forced to modularize my code again and import/export certain items in order for the program to run. This was actually pretty cool to learn.",
